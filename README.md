# Cuser
Implementing a Custom User Model in Django 3.1 and Python 3.8.5

I Have being building django projects for 3 years now.
I self taught myself django but got Fortune Tede of KudiGo helping me out when I got stuck.

I learnt mostly from books and videos by building projects.
I will count myself as an intermediate Django developer.

As a built more projects, I realised that the default django user model is limited in so many ways.
So I decided to learn how to built my own user models but I didn't know how to.

I opened the django docs and learning from the docs, I decided to create this so that other people 
like me could benefit.

THere are not a lot of resources on the topic, I find the few available not always be difficult
done the way it is implemented in the docs and this even makes it more confusing.

I wrote Cuser, to look very similar to what is in the docs, and I will try my best to 
add comments at places it that it will help clearify my code from time to time.

If you go through Cuser but you want more explanation, You can reach out to me
on Twitter for me to explain it to you and probably help you implement your own
in your projects.
